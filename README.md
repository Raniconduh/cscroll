# cscroll

A small and efficient file manager written in C.

## Usage

If an argument is provided, cscroll will open the path supplied. Otherwise it will open in the current working directory. ([see 'Options'](#options))

Files will be highlighted and shown with an identifier corresponding to the file type. If compiled with icons and the icons option is set, a nerd icon corresponding to the file's type will be shown to its left. ([see 'Icons'](#icons))

Default configurations can be specified in the [config file](#config-file). These will be overwritten by any flags passed via the command line or through the `set` command but will persist in the file.

#### Colors & Identifiers:

* Red, `?`: Unknown File
* Yellow, `#`: Block or char device
* Yellow, `|`: FIFO (named pipe)
* Green, `*`: File is executable
* Blue, `/`: Directory
* Cyan, `@`: Symbolic link
* Magenta, `=`: Unix socket
* Magenta, No identifier: Media file
* Red, No identifier: Archive or compressed file
* White, No identifier: Regular file

Files that are executable but have another identifier will keep the identifier but be colored green. Files that are either media files or archives will be colored respectively but will keep an identifier if they have one.

Symbolic links that point to directories will be suffixed with `@ => /` and may be entered as a normal directory. Otherwise, deletion of a symbolic link will not delete whatever the link points to; only the link itself and opening one will open what the link points to.

File colors can also be customized. ([see variables](#variables))

Additionally, in long mode, the leftmost character in the mode string will correspond to file type:

* `.`: Regular file
* `b`: Block device
* `c`: Character device
* `d`: Directory
* `l`: Symbolic link
* `|`: FIFO/named pipe
* `=`: Unix socket

### Options

* `-n`: Negate the next option
* `-A`: Show dotfiles in listings but exclude . and ..
* `-a`: (Only available in oneshot mode) List all dotfiles including . and ..
* `-c`: Use colors in listings (default)
* `-h`: No-op: for compatibility with ls
* `-i`: Show icons (default)
* `-p`: Print the path cscroll ends in. Useful for commands like `cd $(cscroll -p)` to cd into the last directory
* `-l`: Display files in long mode (file mode, owner, group, size, modification time)
* `--help`: Show the help screen
* `--oneshot`: cscroll will print the files and exit, acting as if it were `ls`. The `-p` option will have no effect in oneshot mode.
* `--`: Stop parsing command line flags

Options beginning with a single `-` may be stacked: e.g. `cscroll -la`. The `-n` option is useful with the `-i` and `-c` flags (`-ni`, `-nc`) to turn off icons or colors. The `--` option allows running cscroll in a directory which is prefixed with a `-`. E.g. `cscroll -- -mydir` will open cscroll in the directory `-mydir`.

### Commands

* `j`, `Ctrl+n` or `down arrow key`: Move the cursor down
* `k`, `Ctrl+p` or `up arrow key`: Move the cursor up
* `h`, `Ctrl+b` or `left arrow key`: Enter the previous directory
* `l`, `Ctrl+f`, `right arrow key`, or `enter key`: If the file the cursor is on is a directory, enter that directory. Otherwise open the file with `xdg-open`
* `g`, `home key`: Place cursor on first file
* `G`, `end key`: Place cursor on last file
* `.`: Toggle whether or not to show dot files
* `d`: Delete the file the cursor is on (a [prompt](#options-prompt) will be shown first)
* `m`: Mark the file the cursor is on
* `r`: Rename the file the cursor is on ([see file renaming](#renaming))
* `c`: Cut the file the cursor is currently on or all the marked files. Pressing twice in the same directory will cancel the cut
* `p`: Paste all cut files into the current directory. Pasting in the same directory where the cut originated will cancel the cut
* `:`: Open a commands prompt ([see 'Command Prompt' section](#command-prompt))
* `/`: Search for a file in the current directory using a POSIX regex
* `!`: Run a shell command ([see shell commands](#shell-commands))
* `q`: Quit

A mouse click will move the cursor to file that was clicked on. If the cursor was already on that file, it will be opened or cscroll will enter it if it is a directory.

#### Options Prompt

An options prompt will pop up in the center of the screen with text at the top of the pop-up and one or more options at the bottom. To move the cursor to the left, any of the left or up keys will work. To move it to the right, any of the down or right keys (except for enter) will work. To select the current option, press either the space bar or the enter key. The `q` key will quit the prompt without selecting an option.

#### Command Prompt

The command prompt will show up upon pressing `:` and the prompt itself is prefixed with a colon. Here you may enter multi-character commands. Available commands are:

* `ma`: **M**ark **A**ll files in the directory
* `mu`: **M**ark **U**nmark: Unmarks all files on the directory
* `ca`: **C**ut **A**ll files in the current directory

* `set`: Set a variable to true ([see Variables](#variables))
* `unset`: Unset a variable (set to false, [see Variables](#variables))
* `var`: Set a variable equal to something `var variable = false` ([see Variables](#variables) and ['config file'](#config-file))

* `i`: Open the [info buffer](#info-buffer) viewer

#### Renaming

The `r` command will show a prompt (similar to a command prompt but without a prefix) where the new file name is to be expected. A file may only be renamed within the same directory.

E.g. if the directory cscroll is in is `/home/user/downloads` and the file `image.png` is renamed to `/home/user/image.png`, it will fail. The file can only be renamed to something like `my_image.png`. (Attempting to move a file across directories is not possible with the rename function.) Mass renaming is not possible.

#### Shell Commands

Pressing `!` will open a prompt prefixed with `!` which will run the shell command entered into it. Entering `%f` will format the command entered with the name of the file the cursor is currently on. To escape this format (i.e. to not have it be replaced with the file name), enter `%%f`. The output will be literally `%f`.

E.g. `vim %f` will format to `vim FILE` where `FILE` is the name of the file the cursor is on. `echo %%f`, however, will format to `echo %f` and the output of the command will literally be `%f`.

#### Info Buffer

The info buffer shows all information messages, warnings, and errors. The `:i` command opens a pager to view every message at once. To scroll up the buffer, any of the up keys will work. To scroll down, any of the down keys will work. To close the buffer, press `q` or `Ctrl+c`.

When the info buffer is not opened, the latest info message will be shown at the bottom of the screen.

Messages highlighted in red are errors, yellow are warnings, and messages without highlighting are general information.

#### Config File

The config file allows for the specification of default variables cscroll will always set. The default location of the file will be `$HOME/.config/cscroll/config`, but the default configuration directory can be changed with the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable.

The general syntax for configurations is `variable = value`. The variables that may be specified are the same as the ones the `set` command may take and are specified [here](#variables).

The values that variables may be set to are limited to `true`, `false`, and a string in the case of a color variable.

Example config file:

```
long = true
icons = false
dir_color = "#123abc"
```

This will, by default, turn on long mode, turn off icons, and set the color of directories to the specified hex code. However, variables can still be set and unset when in cscroll itself. To turn off long listing mode once again, for example, one could run this command in cscroll: `:unset long`.

Variables specified in the configuration file will also be overwritten by command line arguments to cscroll. If the configuration specifies to show icons, the `-ni` flag will turn them off regardless. Configuration file values are of the least significance in regards to all other ways to set variables, although they will last indefinitely and will work for each run.

#### Variables

Variables allow setting defaults or changing settings while in cscroll itself as opposed to having to stop and restart it with different flags. Variables are set with `var = value`

##### Boolean Variables

Boolean variables hold the value `true` or `false`. The following are boolean variables:

* `color`: Turn on or off colors.
* `dots`: Enable or disable the listing of dot files
* `icons`: (If compiled with icons) If true, show [icons](#icons). Otherwise don't.
* `long`: Turn on or off long mode

##### String Variables

String variables can hold and value encased in two double-quotes. Single quotes will not create a valid string. For example, `variable = "my string"`. The following are string variables:

* `opener`: Change the default file opener from `open` on Mac `xdg-open` on other systems to the specified value.

The following string variables control the colors for each type of file specified by their names. Their values must be specified as six digit hexadecimal numbers with or without a leading hash (#). An example could be `dir_color = "#123abc"`.

* `dir_color`: Directories
* `reg_color`: Regular files (i.e. any file which is not any other color)
* `fifo_color`: FIFO/Named pipes
* `link_color`: Symbolic links
* `block_color`: Block files (typically devices found in `/dev`)
* `char_color`: Character devices
* `sock_color`: Unix sockets
* `unknown_color`: A file that cannot be accessed to determine type
* `exec_color`: Any executable file
* `media_color`: Any media file (pictures, audio files, videos)
* `archive_color`: Any file archives (tarballs, zips, etc.)

#### Icons

[Nerd icons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) are special icons built into certain fonts. In cscroll, they are used to show a known or predicted file type. The icons will be on the left of any given file. However, the use of these icons requires a patched font or font with icons built in. Without such a font, the icons may show as a little white box outline or the escape code itself may be shown (something similar to `~]~J`). Installation instructions may be found in the linked site.

If you wish to use cscroll without any icons, they can be turned off at compile time with the `ICONS` variable, in the configuration file and at runtime with the `icons` variable, and with the command line option `-ni`.

## Compilation

To run, cscroll requires libncurses and libterminfo. Compilation, however, also requires pkg-config.

On Debian and Ubuntu based system, libncurses may be titled `libncurses-dev` or simply `libncurses` and can be installed with `sudo apt install libncurses{,-dev}`.

Any compilation configuration can be done in the `config.mk` file.

To compile, simply run `make`. Nerd icons are enabled by default. To turn them off, compile with `ICONS=0`.

The program will then be accessible by running `./cscroll`.

## Installation

Run `make install` to install the binary to the directory pointed at by the set PREFIX and DESTDIR.
